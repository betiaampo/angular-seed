## Step 1: Download and Install the Software

## Step 2: Connect and Update Your Device
 
The next step is to connect your Autocom CDP+ BT device to your PC via Bluetooth. You need to pair your device with your PC first. To do that, go to the Bluetooth settings on your PC and search for new devices. You should see your Autocom CDP+ BT device with its serial number. Select it and enter the default password 1234 to pair it.
 
After pairing your device, you need to update its firmware to match the software version. To do that, open the Autocom software on your PC and go to the settings menu. Select "Hardware setup" and then "Test" to test your device connection. If everything is OK, you will see a green tick next to your device.
 
Then, select "Update firmware" and follow the instructions to update your device firmware. This may take a few minutes. Do not disconnect or turn off your device during the update process.
 
## Step 3: Activate Your Software
 
The final step is to activate your software using a file activation method. To do that, you need to generate a FileActivation.xml file from your Autocom software and send it to someone who can activate it for you using a keygen.
 
To generate the FileActivation.xml file, open the Autocom software on your PC and go to the settings menu. Select "Software activation" and then "Activate via USB". You will see a message asking you to save a FileActivation.xml file on your desktop.
 
Save the file and then send it to someone who can activate it for you using a keygen. You can find someone who can do that online or contact your seller for help. The keygen is very expensive and not available for public use.
 
After receiving the activated FileActivation.xml file, copy it back to your desktop and overwrite the original one. Then, open the Autocom software again and go to the settings menu. Select "Software activation" and then "Activate via USB". You will see a message confirming that your software is activated.
 
## Conclusion
 
That's how you can update and activate your old Autocom CDP+ BT with serial number 3555 for the latest software version. By following these steps, you can enjoy all the features and functions of this professional diagnostic tool.
