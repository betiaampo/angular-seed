- Get full control of the marble. The first thing you need to do is get comfortable with the controls and the physics of the marble. The marble will roll faster or slower depending on how much you tilt the virtual joystick, and you can see your speed by the white border around it. You can also jump by tapping the jump button, which is useful for clearing obstacles and building up speed.
- Use bunny hops to build up quick speed. One of the most important techniques in Marble It Up! is the bunny hop. This is when you quickly tap the jump button while rolling, which will make you do a short hop that increases your momentum. You can do multiple bunny hops in a row to gain even more speed, especially if you are going downhill. Bunny hopping is essential for getting fast times and reaching high places.
- Use power ups to get through. As you progress through the levels, you will encounter various power ups that can give you an edge. The Jump power up looks like a green arrow and lets you launch into the air with great height. The Boost power up looks like a yellow lightning bolt and gives you a sudden burst of extreme speed. The Feather Fall power up looks like a yellow feather and slows down your descent speed. Use these power ups wisely to overcome challenges and find shortcuts.
- Grab the time slowing power ups. Some levels have special power ups that look like blue clocks. These power ups will slow down time for a few seconds, which can be very helpful for navigating tricky sections or avoiding hazards. Try to grab these power ups whenever you see them, as they can make a big difference in your final time.
- Keep practicing for the better times. Marble It Up! is a game that rewards practice and repetition. The more you play a level, the more familiar you will become with its layout, obstacles, power ups, and secrets. You will also improve your control and timing of the marble, which will help you shave off precious seconds from your time. Don't give up if you fail or get a low rank - just try again and learn from your mistakes.
- Chase those elusive diamond ranks. Each level has four ranks that you can earn depending on your time: bronze, silver, gold, and diamond. Diamond ranks are the ultimate challenge in Marble It Up!, as they require near-perfect execution and speed. To get a diamond rank on a level, you will need to use every trick in the book: bunny hops, power ups, shortcuts, time slowing, and more. You will also need to memorize the level and avoid any mistakes or crashes. Getting a diamond rank on every level is not easy, but it is very satisfying and rewarding.
- Find the level for you. Marble It Up! has 60 levels in total, each with its own theme, style, and difficulty. Some levels are more straightforward and linear, while others are more open-ended and exploratory. Some levels are more focused on speed and momentum, while others are more focused on precision and timing. Some levels have more hazards and obstacles, while others have more power ups and secrets. There is a level for everyone in Marble It Up!, so find the ones that suit your preferences and skills.
- Watch out for mechanisms and obstacles. Marble It Up! is not just about rolling on flat surfaces - there are also many moving parts and interactive elements that can help or hinder you. You will encounter ramps, bridges, platforms, fans, magnets, switches, lasers, spikes, bumpers, cannons, portals, and more throughout the levels. Some of these can launch you into the air or boost your speed, while others can slow you down or knock you off course. Pay attention to your surroundings and learn how to use them to your advantage.
